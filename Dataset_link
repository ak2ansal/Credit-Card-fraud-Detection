ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Provider: ULB (UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles)

This dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data collected over two days by a European cardholder. It presents a binary classification problem focused on distinguishing fraudulent transactions (positive class) from legitimate ones (negative class). Out of 284,807 total transactions, only 492 are frauds â€” making this a highly imbalanced dataset.

Key Characteristics:

Number of records: 284,807

Number of features: 30 (28 anonymized PCA-transformed features + 'Time' + 'Amount')

Target variable: Class (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

Class distribution:

Legitimate: 284,315

Fraudulent: 492

No missing values

Highly imbalanced â€“ frauds represent only ~0.17% of all transactions

Usage in Project: This dataset serves as the basis for training and evaluating a machine learning model for fraud detection. Due to the class imbalance, special preprocessing techniques like undersampling, data augmentation, and cost-sensitive evaluation are applied.
